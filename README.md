### 2018-11-21: Introduction to Julia

#### 1. Introduction to Julia (by Csaba Hoch)

*  Abstract:

   > Julia is a high-level, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language. The Julia source code is compiled to native machine code by a JIT (just-in-time) compiler, which makes Julia able to provide an environment for writing high performance applications. Nowadays it is mostly used for performing calculations and scientific analyses, thanks to its speed and convenient language constructs.
   >
   > In this presentation Csaba will show the basics of the Julia language, its most important principles, capabilities, and the ecosystem around the language. Csaba will also give an overview about how they use Julia in a production environment.

#### 2. Julia is fast - What, Why, How (by Avik Sengupta)

*   Abstract:

    > In this talk, Avik will dive deep into Julia's performance claims, showing how it compares to other languages, and explaining the language features that make it so.

*   [Avik's Jupyter notebook.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JuliaComputing/JuliaBoxTutorials/blob/master/introductory-tutorials/intro-to-julia/09.%20Julia%20is%20fast.ipynb)
